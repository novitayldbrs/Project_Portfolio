# [Project 2: Customer Churn Using Logistic Regression](https://github.com/novitayldbrs/cust_churn)
## Project Overview
* Customer churn is impoartant to predict in terms of used as an indicator of customer satisfaction.One company can improve quality that need to be explored
* Algorithm used: Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier
* Use F-1 Score to measure the accuracy of each model
* Find out that Logistic Regression is an effective model to use
