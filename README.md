Data Science Project 

# [Project 1: Employment Segmentation using Machine Learning: Project Overview](https://github.com/novitayldbrs/clusteringemployee)
* Analyze employment behavior with given variable to segmenting them into a few cluster 
* Using K-Means cluster method to decide thr most effective number of cluster 
* Do data preparation, normalization, exploratory data analysis and modeling
* Evaluate the model using Davis-Bouldin Index

# [Project 2] Customer Churn Using Logistic Regression: Project Overview
* Customer churn is impoartant to predict in terms of used as an indicator of customer satisfaction.One company can improve quality that need to be explored
* Algorithm used: Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier
* Use F-1 Score to measure the accuracy of each model
